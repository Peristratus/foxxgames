 ## Description

 This milestone project is part of my on going Full Stack Software Developer course at Canadian Business college in collaboration with the Code Instititute.
 The website is based on a fictional FOXX GAMES website, the website theme is based on vintage Atari, Nintendo and Sega games.The user will be able to 
 scroll through the web page, buy games and play two games, the classic 1979 Asteroid game and the 2020 Asteriod game.I went through two tutorials and 
 implemented the code, the results was two fully functional games, I also took a tutorial on Neural networks for the 1979 Asteriod game and managed to 
 build a Neural network that enabled my computer to learn how to play the game, this resulted in an Artifical inteligent software that became better 
 over time as I allowed the computer to practice playing the game, the first score was 80,789 level 15 utilizing all 3 lives, the second attempt was 
 97,980 level 17 utilizing all 3 lives, I now have a good understanding of neural networks and the math associated with neural networks, i intend to 
 continue improving on my skills by taking a course with intellipat on machine learning and eventually become certified by IBM for Machine learning and 
 Artifical Intelligence, this project is supposed to showcase my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript & Jquery. Other features include the intigation of Pay 
 Pal and emailjs API into the webdesign, the website also features parallax effect and carousel slide.The development of this website is purely for 
 educational purposes and not intended for commercial use.

## Technologies 

The technologies employed to develop this web application was based on the principles of Design for X (DFX) also know as Design for excellence, the basis of this methodology is based
on cost to quality, making effective use of resources to minimize cost and relay more on innovation and technical knowledge to meet the users expectations.The software's used are mostly free 
and meet the **Requirements Traceability Catalog Table 1.0** to develop this website, innovation and technical knowledge was based on my recently aquired skills based on my journey so 
far with Code institute and the Canadian Business College.

 ## Deployment
 After my User Acceptance Testing (UAT) I pushed the final version of my code to git hub , in my commit message I cataloged each change before my final push, the steps I took 
 can be seen below, my project is now live on [GitHub]( https://peristratus.github.io/bootstrap/)

 1. Complete the User UAT evaluation and made sure that all phase 1 codes are funtional and operational.
 2. Used git commit -m to catalog all my changes in line with UAT requirement.
 3. Used git push to push my final version to my git hub repository. 
 4. Clicked on settings on my Peristratus/bootstrap repository and scrolled down to github pages.
 5. Clicked on select branch drop down menu and then selected master.
