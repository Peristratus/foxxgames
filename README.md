 ## Description

 This mini project is part of my on going Full Stack Software Developer course at Canadian Business college in collaboration with the Code Instititute.
 The website is based on a fictional resume website for Rosie Odenkirk, this project is supposed to showcase my skills in HTML,CSS, JavaScript , Jquery 
 other features include the intigation of google maps, GitHub and EMAILjs API into the webdesign. I also have a landing page with some additional design & features 
 to lure more users to the website and keep them entertained while exploring the landing page, there are pictures of the HTML, CSS and jS icons , when the mouse hovers
 over these images at the bottom of the page, they float up, once any of the images are clicked by the user the image on the right will change and this event will
 trigger a change in the landing page color. Additional features are once the page is loaded this trigger some audio music to play in the background, once 
 the user navigates through the nav link the music stops, if the user remains on the landing page the music continues playing for 2mins. The music type selected 
 is part of Rosie's elevator statement.

## User-Acceptance-Testing

The UAT will define the criteria by which the website is considered to be "working",high, medium or low defects will be identified and cataloged for further improvements or regression testing.
The UAT critreria and results will confirm if the website can handle required task in a real-world scenarios, according to the Requirements Traceability Catalog Table 1.0.

## Technologies 

The technologies employed to develop this web application was based on the principles of Design for X (DFX) also know as Design for excellence, the basis of this methodology is based
on cost to quality, making effective use of resources to minimize cost and relay more on innovation and technical knowledge to meet the users expectations.The software's used are mostly free 
and meet the **Requirements Traceability Catalog Table 1.0** to develop this website, innovation and technical knowledge was based on my recently aquired skills based on my journey so 
far with Code institute and the Canadian Business College.

Technologies deployed on this project:

 1.  For email API plug in [emailjs](https://www.emailjs.com/)
 2.

---------------------------------------------

 ## Deployment
 After my User Acceptance Testing (UAT) I pushed the final version of my code to git hub , in my commit message I cataloged each change before my final push, the steps I took 
 can be seen below, my project is now live on [GitHub]( https://peristratus.github.io/bootstrap/)

 1. Complete the User UAT evaluation and made sure that all phase 1 codes are funtional and operational.
 2. Used git commit -m to catalog all my changes in line with UAT requirement.
 3. Used git push to push my final version to my git hub repository. 
 4. Clicked on settings on my Peristratus/bootstrap repository and scrolled down to github pages.
 5. Clicked on select branch drop down menu and then selected master.
